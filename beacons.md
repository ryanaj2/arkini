## Beacons

We want every beacon to be worth the risk. Additionally, even high level players should find mostly useful things, even in low-level beacons.

#### Beacon Setup

Each normal beacon will have either useful equipment or materials. Each bonus beacon (with a ring around it) will have items to help with taming creatures.

The types of materials, equipment and items will vary depending on the level of the beacon. For example, a normal white beacon could contain a set of hide armor, or a spear, etc. A bonus white beacon could contain dodo or dilo kibble.

#### Types of normal beacons

1. Materials
2. Armor
3. Weapons
4. Tools
5. Consumables - _food, potions, etc_
6. Cosmetic - _dyes and costumes_

#### Types of bonus beacons

1. Kibble
2. Knockout - _level-specific narcotic weapons_
3. Saddles
4. Minigame - _A saddle, kibble, and other equiement required to tame a particular dino_
